R script workflow is as follows: 
1. leaftraitsGCB.R- runs PCA ordination of leaf traits and ANOVA for leaf N by root symbiont type. Saves output 'PCA_traits_euclidian.csv'
2. brmssetupGCB.R-organizes and scales data for brms models (climate, leaf traits, soil abiotic, root symbiont, 16S and ITS richness). Saves output 'GCB_brms_data.Rdata'  
3. brmsGCB.R-runs brms models for alpha diversity. Calculates parameter estimates and bayesian confidence intervals. 
4. betadivGCB.R-runs NMDS and adonis perMANOVA models for beta diversity.
5. taxaabundGCB.R-runs linear models for relative read abundance of taxa at the phylum level. 
6. indicsppGCB.R-runs indicator spp analysis.
